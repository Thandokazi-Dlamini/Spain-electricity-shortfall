# Spain-electricity-shortfall

# Introduction
In the modern world, electricity is the backbone of societal functioning, powering everything from our homes to our industries. A reliable and sustainable energy supply is not just a convenience but a necessity for maintaining and enhancing the quality of life. With the rise of environmental concerns and the evident limitations of non-renewable energy sources, the shift towards renewable energy infrastructure is not just desirable but imperative.

Spain, recognizing the urgency of this global shift, is at a pivotal point in its energy policy. The nation's commitment to a sustainable future is reflected in its active tracking of energy production from both non-renewable and renewable sources. As it stands at the crossroads of energy reform, Spain is exploring significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure to ensure a sustainable and secure energy future.

# Problem Statement
The government of Spain, in its pursuit of energy reform, faces the challenge of understanding the complex dynamics of energy production and consumption. The critical task at hand is to analyze the shortfall in energy generation, especially from non-renewable sources, and to predict future deficits. This analysis is vital for strategic planning and investment in renewable energy sources to mitigate the risks associated with non-renewable energy dependency.

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the daily shortfall in energy generation in Spain. This model will consider various city-specific weather features, such as atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and humidity, among others, to forecast the gap between energy supply from fossil fuels and the contribution of renewable sources. The insights derived from this project will inform the government's decision-making process regarding the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, ultimately contributing to a sustainable energy future for Spain.
